### Books I'm Reading:
I just finished reading Anna Lembke's "Dopamine Nation: Finding balance in the age of indulgence" after listening to her interview on the Huberman Lab podcast. Such a great read, really interesting to learn how pleasure and pain balance one another and how that links to addiction. 

You can find past books I've read and my notes on them in my Notion library [here](https://www.notion.so/415f577104a04a6f914d5cb6304a5ab8?v=a2663f82bbb54e1cb219923409bc0511).


### Graduate School:
#### Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA
I'm a 3rd year Medical Informatics PhD Candidate at UCLA in [Dr. Alex Bui's](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"} lab. My research centers on the use of digital health data as taken from smartphones and smartwatches to enable monitoring of mental health. A key focus point for me is ensuring fair and equitable implementation of algorithms used.

I just passed my oral qualifying exam and advanced to candidacy woooo. Recently submitted a manuscript for our work on [covidcompare.io](https://www.covidcompare.io){:targe="_blank} to JAMIA where it was rejected and redirected to JAMIA Open where we are now waiting on a decision.

My research is centered on data from a [collaboration between UCLA and Apple](https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html) to study mental health and depression through mobile health. We've begun to have access to initial data sets. Excited to take the work I've been thinking and writing about and actually apply it on these data.

#### UCLA Biodesign Fellowship
At the end of August the [UCLA Biodesign program](https://biodesign.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} officially started. We had 1.5 week long bootcamp where we had workshops, socials, and really cool speakers present. In September we began clinical immersion where we shadow in different areas of the hospital to learn about key pain points where we may innovate. It has been amazing to have the opportunity to do this immersion, I've learned so much about how health systems work and am beginning to appreciate the complexities and barriers to innovation within medicine. Having 3 team mates who are doctors has made it much easier to fire off too many dumb questions and actually get answers that have improved my knowledge of medicine tremendously. We've also been taught how to do proper market research and really dig in and think about what a need is and how to approach it in a way the aligns with regulation, funding, and actual impact.

### Other Things In My Life
#### Meditation
I've been meditating for a couple years now, and for most of it followed a mantra based meditation practice from [AYP](https://www.aypsite.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} which typically involves 2 ~30 minute sessions per day. For the last year+ I decided to shift to the methods taught in the book The Mind Illuminated by [Culadasa](http://culadasa.com/about/){:target="_blank"}. The methods taught in the book feel more well suited to a western audience, it is reminiscent of weight training without entirely discarding eastern knowledge and influence.

#### Guitar
I've played the guitar since I was in middle school, but never felt good. I'm still not good, I don't know how to "jam" with other players, don't know music theory. But at least I can solo in a minor pentatonic pretty well. I've started to learn more theory and fundamentals and am really enjoying it. Videos from [Ben Eller](https://www.youtube.com/user/BenEllerGuitars){:target="_blank"} have been very useful. 

#### Surfing
My housemate got me in to surfing during the pandemic aaaand I'm hooked. It is so much fun but I suck so much at it. Recently got my first surfboard because it was on sale at Costco (the Wavestorm 5'8" retro fish) and no longer have to borrow my friends.

#### Fitness
My roommate from the Freshman year dorms, Will Han, has been coaching me for the last 9 months to help me get swole.
He's helped me a ton with understanding the right way to eat, how to look at my fitness goals, and how to workout. Been going to UCLA's graduate student gym because it is finally open again and am loving having access to actual workout equipment again.
