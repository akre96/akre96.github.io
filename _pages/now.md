## As of June 4th 2022
Overall I'm doing well. The easing of restrictions related to COVID-19 has filled out my social calendar hard which has been incredibly fun. The flip side is I find my self struggling to do the wellness habits and hobbies I grew to love when locked down.

### Books I'm Reading:
Started reading "Healing: Our Path from Mental Illness to Mental Health" by Thomas Insel a couple months ago but have been very slowly going through it. It is interesting, I just have been reading less recently.

You can find past books I've read and my notes on them in my Notion library [here](https://www.notion.so/415f577104a04a6f914d5cb6304a5ab8?v=a2663f82bbb54e1cb219923409bc0511).


### Graduate School:
I'm in person most days now, suddenly went from being primarily remote to primarily in person. Mondays and Fridays I still try to stay full remote though when possible.

#### Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA
I'm a 3rd year Medical Informatics PhD Candidate at UCLA in [Dr. Alex Bui's](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"} lab. My research centers on the use of digital health data as taken from smartphones and smartwatches to enable monitoring of mental health. Recently after implementing a couple different models I've realized it is in fact _hard_ to predict mood from passive wearable device data. Actually thinking of writing a paper on why it is hard though.

My research is centered on data from a [collaboration between UCLA and Apple](https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html) to study mental health and depression through mobile health. We've begun to have access to initial data sets. Excited to take the work I've been thinking and writing about and actually apply it on these data.

#### UCLA Biodesign Fellowship
I've been part of [UCLA's Biodesign Discovery Fellowship](https://biodesign.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} since August 2021. The program has been a phenomenal experience and we graduate from it in just a couple of weeks (June 23rd). I've had the opportunity to shadow in many areas of the hospital, learn from really cool speakers, and work with people much more capable/accomplished than myself. Broadly learned so much about medical technology entrepreneurship and feel much more confident in my understanding of the space. Our team (Airosolve) pitched at the Rice Business Plan competition in April and now were building our first prototype.

### Other Things In My Life
#### Meditation
I've been meditating since 2017 (wow 5 years now) and while I was much less consistent the first year, it has become a keystone habit in my daily routine. Recently however I've definitely felt myself being less focused during the sessions themselves. I used to get through and enter a real meditation zone frequently but now am mostly distracted when I sit. I still do at least 10-15 minutes and normally 20-25 but its far from my "normal" during the pandemic where I was at 30-45 minutes. Improving my meditations is definitely a focus for me moving forward.

#### Guitar
I've played the guitar since I was in middle school, but never felt good. I'm still not good, I don't know how to "jam" with other players, don't know music theory. But at least I can solo in a minor pentatonic pretty well. Rarely play in the last 2 months though.

#### Surfing
Been a year-ish now since I started surfing as a pandemic hobby. Still find it difficult, tiring, and incredibly fun. I may still spend 90% of my time falling or getting wrecked but now when conditions are nice I can _do the thing_. Favorite spot I've been to is definitely San Onofre. 

#### Fitness
I meant to start cutting but had an unintentional bulk these last two months. On the bright side I can finally deadlift 315 for 3 reps, squat 195 for 3-4 reps, and bench 165 lbs for 2-3 reps. Mobility has become much more important to me recently and I've tried very actively ensuring full range of motion on lifts and started some mobility exercises. Also trying hard to actually incorporate cardio in to my weeks but its the easiest for me to forget since I mainly only want to do it because I should probably have better cardiovascular fitness if I want to live, there isn't a fun short term target like with strength training that I care about.
