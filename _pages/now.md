### Books I'm Reading:

1. "Black Reconstruction in America" by W.E.B Du Bois.

You can find past books I've read and my notes on them in my Notion library [here](https://www.notion.so/415f577104a04a6f914d5cb6304a5ab8?v=a2663f82bbb54e1cb219923409bc0511).


### Graduate School:
#### Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA
I'm a 3rd year Medical Informatics PhD Student at UCLA in [Dr. Alex Bui's](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"} lab. My research centers on the use of digital health data as taken from smartphones and smartwatches to enable monitoring and prevention of mental health disorder. A key focus point for me is ensuring fair and equitable implementation of algorithms used.

I've mainly been working on my thesis proposal and hope to advance to candidacy by the end of November. Recently submitted a manuscript for our work on [covidcompare.io](https://www.covidcompare.io){:targe="_blank} to JAMIA where it was rejected and redirected to JAMIA Open where we are now waiting on a decision.

My research is centered on data from a [collaboration between UCLA and Apple](https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html) to study mental health and depression through mobile health. We've begun to have access to initial data sets. Excited to take the work I've been thinking and writing about and actually apply it on these data.

#### UCLA Biodesign Fellowship
At the end of August the [UCLA Biodesign program](https://biodesign.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} officially started. We had 1.5 week long bootcamp where we had workshops, socials, and really cool speakers present. I had gotten used to being ready by 9am for remote work over the last 2 years and so was somewhat overwhelmed by having to look professional, in person, at _8 am_. Overall been a great experience so far and I think this aligns well with my career goals.  

### Other Things In My Life
#### Meditation
I've been meditating for a couple years now, and for most of it followed a mantra based meditation practice from [AYP](https://www.aypsite.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} which typically involves 2 ~30 minute sessions per day. For the last 6 months I decided to shift to the methods taught in the book The Mind Illuminated by [Culadasa](http://culadasa.com/about/){:target="_blank"}. The methods taught in the book feel more well suited to a western audience, it is reminiscent of weight training without entirely discarding eastern knowledge and influence.

#### Guitar
I've played the guitar since I was in middle school, but never felt good. I'm still not good, I don't know how to "jam" with other players, don't know music theory. But at least I can solo in a minor pentatonic pretty well. I've started to learn more theory and fundamentals and am really enjoying it. Videos from [Ben Eller](https://www.youtube.com/user/BenEllerGuitars){:target="_blank"} have been very useful. 

#### Surfing
My housemate got me in to surfing during the pandemic aaaand I'm hooked. It is so much fun but I suck so much at it. Recently got my first surfboard because it was on sale at Costco (the Wavestorm 5'8" retro fish) and no longer have to borrow my friends.

#### Fitness
My roommate from the Freshman year dorms, Will Han, has been coaching me for the last 9 months to help me get swole.
He's helped me a ton with understanding the right way to eat, how to look at my fitness goals, and how to workout. Been going to UCLA's graduate student gym because it is finally open again and am loving having access to actual workout equipment again.
