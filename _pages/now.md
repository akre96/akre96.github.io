## As of Jan 23rd 2022

### Books I'm Reading:
I just finished reading __Immune__ by Philipp Dettmer. Great book and overview of the immune system, would highly recommend to anyone, learned so much in a way that was easy to digest, fun, and beautifully illustrated.

You can find past books I've read and my notes on them in my Notion library [here](https://www.notion.so/415f577104a04a6f914d5cb6304a5ab8?v=a2663f82bbb54e1cb219923409bc0511).


### Graduate School:
Recently shifted from roughly 50% in-person time to effectively full remote due to Omicron causing a ruckus.

#### Medical Informatics Ph.D. Program at UCLA
I'm a 3rd year Medical Informatics PhD Candidate at UCLA in [Dr. Alex Bui's](https://www.mii.ucla.edu/people/buia/){:target="_blank"} lab. My research centers on the use of digital health data as taken from smartphones and smartwatches to enable monitoring of mental health. A key focus point for me is ensuring fair and equitable implementation of algorithms used.

My research is centered on data from a [collaboration between UCLA and Apple](https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html) to study mental health and depression through mobile health. We've begun to have access to initial data sets. Excited to take the work I've been thinking and writing about and actually apply it on these data.

#### UCLA Biodesign Fellowship
At the end of August the [UCLA Biodesign program](https://biodesign.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} officially started. We had 1.5 week long bootcamp where we had workshops, socials, and really cool speakers present. In September we began clinical immersion where we shadow in different areas of the hospital to learn about key pain points where we may innovate. It has been amazing to have the opportunity to do this immersion, I've learned so much about how health systems work and am beginning to appreciate the complexities and barriers to innovation within medicine. Having 3 team mates who are doctors has made it much easier to fire off too many dumb questions and actually get answers that have improved my knowledge of medicine tremendously. We've also been taught how to do proper market research and really dig in and think about what a need is and how to approach it in a way the aligns with regulation, funding, and actual impact. At this point we have found a clinical need and are interviewing stakeholders to more robustly define the scope of the need to guide what solutions we might have.

### Other Things In My Life
#### Meditation
I've been meditating for a couple years now, and for most of it followed a mantra based meditation practice from [AYP](https://www.aypsite.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} which typically involves 2 ~30 minute sessions per day. For the last year+ I decided to shift to the methods taught in the book The Mind Illuminated by [Culadasa](http://culadasa.com/about/){:target="_blank"}. The methods taught in the book feel more well suited to a western audience, it is reminiscent of weight training without entirely discarding eastern knowledge and influence.

#### Guitar
I've played the guitar since I was in middle school, but never felt good. I'm still not good, I don't know how to "jam" with other players, don't know music theory. But at least I can solo in a minor pentatonic pretty well. I've started to learn more theory and fundamentals and am really enjoying it. Videos from [Ben Eller](https://www.youtube.com/user/BenEllerGuitars){:target="_blank"} have been very useful. 

#### Surfing
Been a year-ish now since I started surfing as a pandemic hobby. Still find it difficult, tiring, and incredibly fun. I may still spend 90% of my time falling or getting wrecked but now when conditions are nice I can _do the thing_. Favorite spot I've been to is definitely San Onofre 

#### Fitness
Started doing the MAPS Anabolic Program and enjoying it so far, the only 2-days a week workouts are a big shift for me from the 4-6 days a week I was doing previously. I do like it though, that and the trigger sessions (effectively <10 minute light exercises 1-3x daily on rest-days) is much easier to fit in to a week than 6 hour long sessions at a gym a week.
